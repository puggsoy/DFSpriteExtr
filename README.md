# DFSpriteExtr
This is a command-line extraction tool for sprites from [Dustforce](http://dustforce.com/). It's actually somewhat pointless since the original sprites are (or soon will be) all available on The Spriter's Resource, but it's an interesting format nonetheless, and was fun to code. Special thanks to [Matt Bush](https://twitter.com/m4ttbush) for helping me with the format.

## Dependencies
- [openfl and lime](http://www.openfl.org/)
- [format](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/format)
- easyconsole (my own library, which I plan to release soon)

## License
Feel free to use this code any way you like; I don't care what you do with it. I'd honestly be glad if it's of any use to anybody.
